# reaktorTaskBackend
This is the backend for the pre-requisite task for Reaktors job listing. In this project I access the data from the 3rd
party API, filter it and create an API that can be called from the frontend.
# Prerequisites and configurations
If you want to run this from your own computer you just need to clone the repository, install with npm install and
run with npm run.
# How to run
This is only the backend so if you wanted to run the whole app please check out the repository [reaktorTaskFrontend](https://github.com/Iispar/reaktorTaskFrontend)
# Tests
This backend does include some basic tests that can be ran by installing the project and npm test.
# Technologies
I used plain javascript for this backend and also axios for retrieving the data from the 3rd party API. I also used express for the communication.
